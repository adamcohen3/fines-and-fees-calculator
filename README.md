# The Hawaii State Judiciary Fines and Fees Calculator 

This calculator is part of an [Access to Justice initiative](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/services/access_to_justice_initiative_main_page) at the Hawai'i State Judiciary. The fines and fees calculator is designed to help people calculate the fines and fees owed on a specific ticket, and if eligible, request either a reduction in their fines or a conversion to community service. This calculator can be used by defendants, attorneys, the court, and the general public.
